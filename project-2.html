                        <p>Due to current limitations listed below, smartphone users could really benefit from a mobile
                            app that replaces the current CNAS cards, making them obsolete for this segment of the
                            population:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>the only piece of paper that you don't have to use anymore is the certificate of
                                employment letter - other than that, you still get everything on paper (prescriptions,
                                referrals for specialist care, and so on)</li>
                            <li>if you don't have the card with you, but you have the prescription (that you got from
                                your family physician via the health card), you can't get your medicine or, best case
                                scenario, you'll have to pay it in full</li>
                            <li>if you travel outside your county and you can't get to your physician for a specialist
                                referral, you can't use the National Healthcare Services for free (unless one goes to
                                the ER), although you are insured</li>
                            <li>you have no knowledge of what's been added to your database related to your health card
                                - only medical professionals have access to your data</li>
                            <li>your PIN code gets overheard by anyone in proximity, because by default all health
                                professionals ask for it aloud, they don't let you type it</li>
                            <li>if you lose the card or it gets stolen you have to wait for anothor one to be emitted,
                                during which you can't make use of it</li>

                            need for cards or paper. Just as medical professionals currently use a card reader, they
                            would use a scanner for your phone. The app would organize a patient's healthcare needs
                            according to each use case:

                            <li>users are at the pharmacy and they need to buy medication using a prescription from
