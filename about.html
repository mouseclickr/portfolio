                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Before I ever heard of UX/UI or product design, I used software like Revit Architecture,
                            AutoCAD,
                            Illustrator, Photoshop, 3D Studio Max. Because I wanted to
                            customize some repetitive tasks in Revit, I started playing with Dynamo, which has Python
                            under
                            the
                            hood. Due to time constraints, it didn't get me where I wanted, but it got me thinking about
                            learning
                            Python.</p>
                        <p>Fast-forward a few years, in 2020 I quit my job, and suddenly found myself with too much
                            time to spare.
                            So I thought I'll finally give Python a chance... and that's how I found out I'll never be a
                            programmer.
                            But that led me to web development, and so I came upon a whole new world of HTML, CSS &
                            JavaScript.</p>
                        <p>Taking time for myself for two years meant experimenting with creative writing and all
                            sorts of object
                            design: ceramics, concrete, restoring furniture and more. In doing so, my interests
                            naturally
                            shifted
                            toward product design. With a bit of research I realized all that EMPATHIZE - DEFINE -
                            IDEATE
                            -
                            PROTOTYPE - TEST is basically what architects do on every project before construction
                            begins, so
                            the
                            same
                            skills apply. Except that product design happens a lot faster.</p>
                        <p class="bold">If working in an architecture studio taught me anything about myself is that I'm
                            an
                            organizer, always
                            focused on how
                            systems work and interact. I prefer working smart not hard, but I surely can do both.
                            Countless
                            meetings, design briefs and construction site visits reinforced my belief I'm a good
                            listener
                            with
                            problem
                            solving acumen.</p>
