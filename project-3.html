                        <p>This project has a real website as starting point,
                            built with a
                            template that isn't always doing what it
                            should. Since I like its design, I didn't want to do a complete makeover, but try
                            to improve its drawbacks:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>the font is too small for large screens</li>
                            <li>the top right buttons are small and change on hover is barely visible</li>
                            <li>home page sliding Carousel is a bit lagging on large screens</li>
                            <li>"Work" page has an uneven grid, hardly responsive - some images appear smaller than the
                                rest on mobile</li>
                            <li>image load is slow</li>
                            <li>Lightbox is slow and changes size as images change size</li>
                            <li>"About" page has very long lines of text, that makes reading annoying</li>
                            <li>the footer isn't fixed to bottom, which on large screens is visually distracting</li>
                            <li>Facebook icon isn't visible on desktop using Firefox, but is visible in Chrome and it
                                makes the vertical scrollbar visible on the home page </li>
                            <li>current year doesn't update (see Copyright line in footer)</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div id="proposal">

                        <p>
                            Small changes make for an improved user experience:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>changed the fonts for nav bar and other texts, to be scalable according to screen size
                            </li>
                            <li>buttons are bigger and change on hover is substantial</li>
                            <li>changed Carousel from sliding to fade-in</li>
                            <li>the image grid is even, with multiple breakpoints for every screen size</li>
                            <li>image load is much faster, and one can no longer see a lag</li>
                            <li>improved Lightbox, that stays in place, no matter the image size </li>
                            <li>redid the entire "About" page, with scalable fonts and lines no longer than 80ch
                            </li>
                            <li>the footer is fixed to bottom on pages where it should (for medium and large screens)
                                and has a different layout</li>
                            <li>all icons are visible on both mobile and other screens - I also included location and
                                links
                                to mail and phone apps, making the contact page redundant</li>
                            <li>current year updates automatically, with a minimal script.js</li>
                        </ol>
