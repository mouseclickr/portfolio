            <h2>Context</h2>

            <p>The intended users of this app are patients, medical professionals would still work withing the
                same
                informatic system. The CAS app is designed to make a connection between that system and the
                users,
                making the use of paper redundant. In order for users to log in, they would have to get a
                security
                password from their family physician, to ensure that the app is conected to the National
                Healthcare
                System.</p>
            <p>However, for this app to fully function, changes in the healthcare system would be necessary. For
                example: prescriptions and referrals shouldn't be in-person events (unless one really wants to),
                physicians should be able to write everything in a database, not on paper, and communicate over
                the
                phone/app, an intercounty database should be the default option.</p>
            <p>With this in mind, the app is meant to be used not just by a segment of population that is
                tech-savvy,
                but
                by other smartphone users too. So functionality is key: the sign-in process should be smooth and
                simple,
                its structure should be straightforward, the language should avoid any misunderstanding.

            <h2>Research</h2>

            <p>From my findings, there is no competition for this kind of app. The only thing that comes closer is
                "Dosarul Electronic de Sănătate" (DES) - a CNAS initiative to make the patients medical history
                easily
                available to medical professionals. But this is a platform that basically logs online your medical
                paper
                trail and lets you read it.</p>
            <p>Let's review some of the aspects that make the current system suboptimal. </p>

            <div class="scenario">
                <h3>Scenario 1</h3>
                <img src="./images/scenario 1.png" alt="">
                <p>You have an acute condition and your GP asks for tests and a specialist consultation. All these
                    include taking paper documents from one point to another. Drawbacks in using the current "paper
                    system":
                <ul>
                    <li>you cannot understand the medic's handwriting</li>
                    <li>you lose it</li>
                    <li>you put it somewhere and it gets torn</li>
                    <li>you always have to have both: paper & card</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="scenario">
                <h3>Scenario 2</h3>
                <img src="./images/scenario 2.png" alt="">
                <p>You have a cronic disease which requires on-going treatment with a specialist from another part
                    of
                    the country. The treatment involves anual check-ups and prescriptions every 90 days. For each
                    renewal you have to make a trip to that physician or send your card to someone in order to get
                    the
                    new prescription.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="scenario">
                <h3>Scenario 3</h3>
                <img src="./images/scenario 3.png" alt="">
                <p>You go to the pharmacy with a prescription. The handwriting on it is illegible and you have to
                    trust
                    the pharmacist to understand it. Your health card can't be scanned, it has to be inserted in a
                    card
                    reader with a short cord, so you are required to say your PIN aloud, and anyone can hear it.
                </p>

        <section class="section-text" id="analysis">
            <div class="h2-wrapper"></div>
            <h2>Analysis</h2>

            <p>To illustrate my findings, I put together 3 user personas. In using the healthcare system, they all
                gravitate toward the same goals, but due to their age, they prioritize things differently:</p>

            <img id="zooming" src="./images/user-personas.png" alt="">

            <div id="modal">
                <img id="modal-content" src="./images/user-personas.png" alt="">
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li>a young mother of three wants efficiency and structure</li>
                <li>a traveling woman with no time to spare wants less time on the road for useless things that
                    could be
                    done through an app</li>
                <li>a retired lady with cancer treatment wants less time spent in the physician's waiting area or
                    traveling to another county for each prescription renewal just beacause that's where her
                    oncologist
                    is</li>
            </ul>

        </section>

        <section class="section-text" id="concept">
            <div class="h2-wrapper"></div>
            <h2>Concept</h2>

            <p>The already existing - let's pretend always functioning - DES platform is very useful, and since you
                can
                access it with a securely generated password received from your GP, I consider it beneficial to be
                in
                connection with the CAS app. If both can be accessed with the same password, why not have them in
                the
                same place? They would complement each other, so that a patient could easily find any medical
                information.</p>
            <p>Since all you need to log in is a password, there is no sign-in / sign-up options, no email address,
                as
                older people may not have one or don't check it regularly. All medical documents received from
                healtcare
                providers would be managed through the app, so there is no real need for an email. </p>
            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            <p>Slider navigation options: autoplay | mouse drag | swipe | arrow keys</p>
        </section>

        <div class="carousel-wrapper">
            <div class="container">
                <div class="carousel"></div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <section>
            <p>A bar code easily accessible from any page would be the thing that replaces the card. Instead of
                having a
                card introduced in a card reader, that doesn't always function, you would reveal the bar code to be
                scanned. </p>
            <p>Other than the DES button to access your medical history, the app contains 4 more sections (buttons
                on
                main page): family physician, pharmacy, specialist physician, medical investigations. It works like
                this: users would ask their GP for a referral, the GP sends one back, but this will go to the
                specialist
                section, because that's where they would use it. The specialist in return sends a referral for an
                MRI,
                and that would be logged in the investigations section. Any prescription sent by a physician would
                enter
                the pharmacy section. </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>This app was not design to replace in-person annual check-ups, and patients should still physically
                report to professionals when necessary. However, as we've seen recently, unexpected events can
                quickly
                prove technologies to be critical.</p>
